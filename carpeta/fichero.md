¿Qué tal estáis? Os mando un *saludo* a **todos**


# **Bakery Exercise 3.0**

![][image1]

Every morning, at **La Espiral Bakery**, Laura opens the shutters before dawn and faces the same question:

**“How many croissants should I bake today?”**

If she bakes too few, some customers will leave without their croissant and sales will be lost (and maybe a few annoyed customers).
If she bakes too many, at the end of the day she’ll have entire trays unsold that she’ll need to sell off cheaply… or throw away.

For the whole exercise, we work with this simple economic model:

* **Regular selling price:** €1.80
* **Promotional price (when `promo = 1`):** €1.50
* **Cost per croissant (raw materials, energy, labor…):** €0.60
* **Value of leftovers at the end of the day (clearance):** €0.25 per unit
* **Maximum oven / production capacity:** 180 croissants per day

Your mission is to help Laura, using data and AI, decide how many croissants to bake each morning to **maximize her profit** without leaving customers without breakfast.

# **Tasks**

1. ### **Mini business understanding (with AI)**

Use an LLM to answer in 8–10 lines:

* What does `lost_sales` mean?
* Which variable should be “predicted”? Why?

  * How do we calculate real demand?
* Which 3 factors in the CSV seem to drive demand the most?
